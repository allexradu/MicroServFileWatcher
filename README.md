# MicroServ File Watcher
MicroServ File Watcher is a huge help when you have to copy a common code in development of Micro Services
It sycs the mirrors file changes to all your microservices.

Let's say you have the folowing folder structure...
+ Microservices/Auth/Common
+ Microservices/Products/Common
+ Microservices/Orders/Common

and you want when you make a change to either of the common folder to be reflected to all the other folders, thats's where MicroServ FileWatcher shines.
